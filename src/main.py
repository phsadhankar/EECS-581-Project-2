Inputs:
    - Number of mines selected by the user (10-20)
    - Mouse input

Outputs:
    A playable Pygame Minesweeper game window

      Used as the starting point for the Minesweeper Pygame implementation.

AI Use Disclosure:

    AI Tool: ChatGPT (GPT-5.6 Luna)

    Use of AI: AI was used to assist with the integration and revision of existing 'main.py' code with other project components and
    existing functions. The AI was also used to help understand Pygame-specific syntax and how 'main.py' interacts with functions and data
    from other source files.

    Prompt: The following prompt is representative of the prompts used to assist with integration between components:
        "Given our architectural components and other source files, assist in editing the Game class to ensure integration, correct logic,
        and reducing complexity. Any suggested changes must be explained so they can be reviewed and understood."

    Changes After AI Assistance: All suggested code changes were reviewed and understood by the editors before being used. One change that was implemented
    was the use of 'continue' statements in the 'events()' method to reduce unnecessary nested 'if' statements. AI assistance was also used to explain Pygame
    syntax related to initializing the screen, display, title, clock, and event handling. The editors verified the logic and made final decisions about which
    changes were incorporated into the file.
